This is the task I loved the most. Because I like creating websites on my own from scratch. I have done a complete web development bootcamp course of nearly 60 hours. So this task was easy for me.
I have used more embedded CSS rather than external CSS because since I am hosting my website in github pages, embedded CSS is comparatively faster than external CSS
