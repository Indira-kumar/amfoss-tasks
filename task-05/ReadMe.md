This task looked pretty easy when I began it. But after sometime it grew harder and harder after debugging all the basic errors. I found out that the game does not work if number of allowed wrong attempts is zero. I debugged that and made sure that we can play the game even with zero allowed wrong attempts. Over all I got an experience to debug a code written by somebody else by understanding the code flow.
