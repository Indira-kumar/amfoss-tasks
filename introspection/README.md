# Why must we choose you?
I am Indira Kumar, and I have been learning programming right from 8th grade. I was an active Quora user. I came to know about amfoss through that. I have read a lot of articles about the club achieving big feats. I vividly remember the time when I read an article describing a student contributing to the VLC media player. That really inspired me. I felt like that’s the kind of work I too want to do in my college life. That’s the whole reason why I choose Amrita university over any of my options. But sadly, I got Coimbatore and Bangalore campuses only. But then fast forward 2 years, On March 9, 2022, when I saw the “Hello, Bengaluru” pdf, my excitement knew no bounds. 

Apart from all this backstory of wanting to be in amfoss. I am the kind of person who learns things fast, but in a lot of things that I want to do, I feel a bit of guidance will bring the best out of me.

# What is your plan for the next 6 months?
For the next 6 months, my plan is to do 3 things:
- Explore open-source programmes like GSoC and MLH fellowship.
- Explore ML.
- I have learned js recently. I want to get excellent in that. 

# How would you contribute back to the club? 
There are lots of opportunities and things to learn in the Computer Science world. I would like to help juniors as well as my fellow students on how to avail these opportunities. I want to mention one thing. In the Bangalore campus, many of my bright friends are strictly bound to academics. I want to inspire them to take up extra things and give them exposure of real-life projects.

# Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The selection process was amazing. The tasks given were so well curated. Each of it had something to teach on a greater level. The LetMeC task taught us how to understand the code written by someone else and debug it to achieve the required goal. Web scrapping has tonnes of applications. I really liked that I learned to do all of them.
