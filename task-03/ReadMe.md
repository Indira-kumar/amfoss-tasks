# Programming

I took up this tasks in pieces. I took screenshots of all the questions and created a word document. I used to stare at the word document in my mobile, whenever I get free time. Then if I get an idea, I will go to onlineGDB to try out different methodologies. Then I will run them in Hackerrank. Whenever I get a question correct, I used to clear the program in my doc. I was able to solve all the questions except Raam and Gifts, Fights on.
