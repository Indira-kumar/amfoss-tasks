I started watching the lecture from day 1 when we were assigned the tasks. But after week-0 and week-1 lectures, I could not see any more lectures. Because, out of the 36 days(initial 30 + extended 6) given to us to complete tasks, my initial 7 days and the last 5 days were periodical exams, and so I got very less time to see lectures of CS50. In the free time I got, I was able to do other tasks pretty well. But this took a bit more time than others and so I was not able to do it completely. But I feel I will do this task even after deadline to learn the CS50 course.
Here I have attached the initial 1 week problems that I completed when I started CS50.
