This task was the one I spent the most time with, because I was delighted by the applications of a web scrapper. From now, I could scrape data from any source if I am doing a bit of research on anything. First I started with GoQuery, and then I tried colly. I was able to scrape techcrunch articles and list of internships from internshala(attached in this folder) with the help of a Youtube video. But for some reason, I was not able to scrape data from forbes. Then after some googling, I figured out that for CSR websites, chromedp and geziyor are good frameworks. Then I decided to go with geziyor, because their documentation was really good. With the help of that, I scrapped the data and formatted the CSV file below.
