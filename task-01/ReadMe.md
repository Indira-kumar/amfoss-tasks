At the first glance, I thought we should do the task manually by starring the repositories. Then when I read the next line, I understood we have to use the script. But anyway I went to all the repositories and saw what they were about. My favourite❤ one is [Vidyaratna](https://github.com/amfoss/vidyaratna). It had all the possible resources we need to be good in various fields.
